The story of how the first Lexus came to be is rather interesting. It is rooted in Toyota's ambition to enter the luxury car market. In the early 1980s, Toyota was already quite popular in the automotive world, and it was known for its reliable, practical cars. However, they wanted more: creating a luxury car that could compete with the best European brands like Mercedes-Benz and BMW.

This led to the "F1" project—a secret initiative to develop a world-class luxury sedan. Toyota didn’t hold back; they invested heavily, bringing together thousands of top engineers, designers, and technicians. The mission was clear: create a car that embodied perfection in every way: performance, comfort, reliability, and technology. The marketing team came up with over 219 names, such as “Vectre,” “Chaparel”, “Verone,” or “Alexis.” The chosen one was “Lexus,” which many say is just an acronym for Luxury Exports to the US.

After years of intense work, the Lexus LS 400 was released in 1989. This wasn’t just another luxury car; it was a game-changer. The LS 400 featured a powerful 4.0-liter V8 engine, advanced technology for the time, and obsessive attention to detail that showed in every aspect of the car. It was clear that Toyota was aiming for the stars.

But it wasn’t just about the car itself. Toyota did its homework, especially in the U.S., where it realized that luxury car buyers wanted a great car and experience. So, it didn’t just launch a car—it launched a brand. Lexus came with a promise of exceptional customer service, which resonated with buyers, particularly in the US, where customer service is vital to the American market.

When the LS 400 hit the market, it made some big waves. It offered the quality that usually came with a much higher price tag, making luxury more accessible. The car received singing reviews, and Lexus was off to a great start.
