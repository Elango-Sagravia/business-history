We all know about Tesla now, a pioneering force in the electric vehicle market. Renowned for its innovative technology, Tesla has achieved remarkable success, becoming one of the most valuable car manufacturers in the world, with a market capitalization exceeding $800 billion.

But did you know that Elon Musk wasn’t the founder of Tesla? The company was actually founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, experienced engineers with a passion for technology. Their journey to founding Tesla began after Eberhard's investment in a small electric car company called AC Propulsion. They recognized the potential for a high-performance electric sports car and set out to create what would eventually become Tesla.

The duo met Elon Musk in 2001 during a Mars Society talk at Stanford University. At that time, Musk had already made a name for himself as a co-founder of PayPal and was looking for new ventures to invest in. Their shared enthusiasm for innovation and sustainable technology led Musk to invest in Tesla in 2004.

After Musk joined, he became the chairman of the board and played a crucial role in shaping the company’s direction. His leadership brought a level of visibility and ambition that accelerated Tesla’s growth. Musk pushed for rapid development and more ambitious projects, focusing on making electric vehicles desirable and mainstream​.

As Tesla grew under Musk's leadership, the original founders faced challenges regarding their roles in the company. Eberhard, who initially served as CEO, left Tesla in 2007 following a legal dispute with Musk. Tarpenning also departed during the early years of Tesla's growth but transitioned to mentoring and investing in environmentally focused startups.

Today, Tesla stands as a leader in the electric vehicle market. The company has expanded its product lineup and established a global presence with manufacturing facilities in various countries, including the United States, China, and Germany.
