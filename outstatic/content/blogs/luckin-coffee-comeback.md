Remember Luckin Coffee? The Chinese coffee chain that made headlines a few years ago for all the wrong reasons? After a huge accounting scandal that nearly brought them down, they’ve made a spectacular comeback—and they’re better than ever!

Back in 2020, Luckin Coffee hit rock bottom when their management was caught inflating sales figures. The scandal was so big that they were delisted from the NASDAQ. It looked like the end of the road for them. But instead of giving up, Luckin took a bold step: they revamped their entire business, putting technology at the heart of everything they do.

Now, Luckin isn’t just a coffee shop—it’s a tech-savvy company that makes grabbing your daily brew easier than ever. Their mobile app is a game-changer. With just a few taps, you can order, pay, and customize your coffee, making it super convenient for busy customers.

While Starbucks focused on high-end cafes in major cities, Luckin took a different approach. They expanded into smaller towns, bringing their affordable, high-quality coffee to more people. And it’s working. Luckin now has over 18,500 stores across China—that’s twice as many as they had just a year ago.
