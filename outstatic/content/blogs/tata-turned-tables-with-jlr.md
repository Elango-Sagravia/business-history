Who would have thought that a company once struggling to sell cars in India would end up owning one of the world's most iconic luxury brands? That’s the incredible story of Tata Motors.

Today, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), a crown jewel of Tata Motors, is raking in billions. In 2023 alone, JLR made a staggering £3 billion on sales of over £23 billion, solidifying its place as a massive success story and creating over 15,000 jobs in the UK.

But this journey wasn’t without its challenges. It all began with a major setback in the late 90s when Tata Motors was trying to establish itself in the passenger car market. Facing tough competition, the company even considered selling its car business.

That’s when Ford came knocking. But instead of a friendly offer, Tata Motors received a harsh reality check. Ford's executives bluntly told Tata that they didn’t understand the car business, implying they were doing Tata a favor by considering the purchase. It was a humiliating blow that could have crushed their confidence.

But Tata Motors didn’t back down. They persevered, improving their cars and building a strong brand. Then, in 2008, the tables turned. Ford, struggling amidst the global financial crisis, decided to sell Jaguar and Land Rover. Tata Motors seized the opportunity, purchasing the two iconic brands for a surprisingly low £1.9 billion.

What was once a moment of humiliation turned into sweet revenge. Tata Motors not only saved Jaguar Land Rover but transformed it into one of the most profitable parts of the Tata Group.
