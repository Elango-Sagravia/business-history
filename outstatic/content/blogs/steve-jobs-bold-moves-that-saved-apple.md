It’s hard to believe now, but Apple—yes, the same Apple behind the iPhone and MacBook—was once on the verge of bankruptcy. Back in the 1990s, things were far from the success story we know today. Apple had soared to fame in the 1980s with the Macintosh, but the next decade hit them hard. By the mid-'90s, a series of missteps and overpriced, underwhelming products had left the company in serious trouble. Apple's stock was in freefall, morale was at rock bottom, and many wondered if the company could survive.

One of Apple’s biggest problems was its competition. Companies like Microsoft were thriving by offering more affordable products, leaving Apple struggling to keep up. By 1996, Apple was hemorrhaging money and losing key staff members. The company cycled through multiple CEOs, each trying something new to no avail. Things looked bleak.

In a bold and unexpected move, Apple bought a small company called NeXT, founded by none other than Steve Jobs—Apple’s former co-founder who had been ousted in the '80s. Bringing Jobs back was a risk, but Apple was desperate. When Jobs returned, he didn’t waste any time shaking things up. He slashed the product line, reducing dozens of underperforming products down to just four core items, with a focus on quality over quantity.

Jobs also did the unthinkable: he partnered with Microsoft, Apple’s biggest rival. Microsoft invested $150 million in Apple, which, while not a massive sum, gave Apple much-needed breathing room. Then came 1998, when Apple launched the iMac—a colorful, all-in-one computer that was a massive hit with consumers and helped reestablish Apple’s presence in the tech world.

This was just the beginning of Apple’s transformation. Over the next decade, Apple introduced products that would change the world: the iPod, iPhone, and iPad. These innovations turned Apple from a struggling computer company into a global tech titan.

Today, Apple is one of the most valuable companies in the world.
