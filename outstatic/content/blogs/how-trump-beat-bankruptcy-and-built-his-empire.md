Ever wonder how Donald Trump, once teetering on the edge of financial disaster, managed to keep his business empire alive? Trump’s journey through financial turbulence is a fascinating tale of risk, survival, and smart maneuvering that allowed him to build a fortune and eventually become President.

In the late 1980s, Trump’s profits were soaring. From 1985 to 1990, he was reportedly making an eye-popping $10,000 an hour, claiming to be worth $3 billion. But by 1990, his empire started to crack. Trump stopped paying personal bills, and his income was rapidly dwindling. By April 1990, his available cash had dropped to just $1.6 million—a far cry from the billions he’d touted.

Trump’s biggest trouble lay with his Atlantic City casinos, especially the newly opened Trump Taj Mahal, which was in financial distress. He owed over $1 billion in bonds for his casinos and couldn’t make the payments. On top of that, around 100 vendors who had worked on the Taj Mahal weren’t getting paid, and his Trump Shuttle airline was running low on cash. Trump’s financial empire was on the verge of collapse.

In April 1990, a financial statement revealed that Trump was worth far less than he had claimed, sending alarm bells ringing at New Jersey’s Casino Control Commission. The commission had the power to revoke his casino licenses, which would have been a fatal blow to his businesses. To keep his licenses, Trump needed to prove he could pay his bills on time, but his finances were in deep trouble.

In a stroke of luck for Trump, the Casino Control Commission decided not to take over his casinos, which would have resulted in a shutdown. Instead, they allowed him to keep his license, giving him a lifeline. With the help of his team—and some state officials—Trump convinced the commission that without immediate action, his entire financial structure could crumble.

Though Trump avoided bankruptcy in 1990, his financial struggles were far from over. By December of that year, he needed an additional $180 million just to stay afloat. Over the next few years, he faced multiple business bankruptcies, including the Trump Taj Mahal’s filing for Chapter 11 in 1991, the first of four bankruptcies his businesses would endure. These bankruptcies allowed Trump to restructure his massive debts and keep operating.

While Trump today often dismisses these bankruptcies as a routine part of doing business, they were critical moments in his career. Thanks to savvy legal maneuvering and government regulatory decisions, Trump managed to avoid personal bankruptcy and rebuild his fortune.
