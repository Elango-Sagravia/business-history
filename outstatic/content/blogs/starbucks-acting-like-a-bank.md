Starbucks isn't just your go-to spot for a morning latte; it’s also quietly acting as a financial giant, right under your nose.

Those Starbucks cards you load up to earn stars? They’re not just for convenience—they’re actually small money vaults. When you add funds to your Starbucks card, you’re effectively giving the company an interest-free loan. And these loans add up. In 2021, customers had a staggering $1.64 billion sitting on their Starbucks cards, an amount that rivals the deposits of some small banks.

Unlike traditional banks, Starbucks doesn’t pay you interest on that money. Instead, they use it to fuel their growth—opening new stores, expanding their product lines, and brewing up even more of that coffee you love. It’s like finding extra cash in your pocket, but for Starbucks.

But Starbucks isn’t just collecting your money; they’re also building a fiercely loyal customer base. Their rewards program, which offers points and freebies, is designed to keep you coming back. It’s a brilliant strategy that turns customers into regulars and regulars into brand advocates.
