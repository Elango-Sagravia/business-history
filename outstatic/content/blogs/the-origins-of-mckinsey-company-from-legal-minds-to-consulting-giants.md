In 1926, a lawyer turned the consulting world upside down. James O. McKinsey, a University of Chicago Law School professor, decided to take a bold leap. Instead of sticking to the law, he ventured into a new realm—consulting. His aim was simple: to transform how businesses approached challenges.

McKinsey saw a gap in the market. At the time, consulting was mostly about legal advice or essential business management. But McKinsey had a different vision. He wanted to use his legal knowledge to tackle business problems in a new way. So, he started a firm that combined accounting and engineering insights.

For McKinsey, accounting was the key to understanding a company’s financial health. It revealed hidden patterns and opportunities. On the other hand, engineering was about solving problems and improving efficiency. McKinsey believed combining these fields could unlock new ways for businesses to succeed.

McKinsey & Company began with these core principles and introduced a method known as the "McKinsey Way." This approach was all about using thorough research and data to solve problems. It wasn’t just about giving advice but providing actionable insights based on solid evidence.

As McKinsey & Company grew, it didn’t stick to just accounting and engineering. It expanded into new areas like strategic planning and marketing. This shift was crucial. It allowed them to stay relevant as business needs evolved. 

McKinsey focused on hiring the best and the brightest from top universities. They didn’t just recruit talent; they nurtured it. Through extensive training and mentoring, McKinsey built a team of highly skilled professionals. McKinsey’s influence spread beyond just consulting. Their former employees, often called the "McKinsey Mafia," moved into important roles across various sectors. This network helped elevate the firm’s reputation even further.

Another aspect that set McKinsey apart was its commitment to thought leadership. They regularly published research and reports that offered deep insights into market trends and business strategies. This focus on producing valuable content helped solidify their position as a leading authority in the consulting world.
