Grameen Bank, established in 1983 by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus in Bangladesh, has become a global symbol of microfinance's potential to alleviate poverty. Unlike traditional banks, Grameen Bank focuses on lending to people living in poverty—primarily women—without requiring collateral or a credit history. Yunus founded the bank after observing that many people in rural Bangladesh were trapped in a cycle of poverty because they lacked access to small loans. Conventional banks considered them too risky, as they had no assets or credit to offer. Yunus’s breakthrough idea was to create a financial system that could reach these marginalized individuals, providing them with the resources to lift themselves out of poverty.

The concept was born when Yunus personally lent $27 to a group of women in a Bangladeshi village who needed money to buy materials for making bamboo stools. These women, who were trapped in debt to local moneylenders charging exorbitant interest rates, were able to turn a small profit with Yunus's loans, and from that success, the seeds of Grameen Bank were planted.

The bank’s unique model is based on trust and peer accountability rather than traditional collateral. Borrowers are organized into small groups, where each member’s success influences the group as a whole. If one borrower struggles to repay their loan, it reflects on the entire group, creating social pressure and mutual support to ensure repayment. This system has led to extraordinarily high repayment rates—around 97%, far higher than most conventional banks achieve with larger, secured loans.

The bank primarily targets women, who make up over 90% of its borrowers, helping them achieve financial independence in societies where they often lack access to credit. A small loan, sometimes as little as $100, can be used to start a business.

Today, Grameen Bank is credited with pioneering the concept of microfinance and inspiring similar models worldwide. Its success has been replicated across Africa, Asia, and Latin America, helping millions of people access financial services. Microfinance institutions (MFIs) using Grameen’s model have grown into a global industry, supporting those who were once considered “unbankable” by traditional institutions.
