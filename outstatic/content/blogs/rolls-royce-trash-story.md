In a surprising turn of events, some of the world’s most luxurious cars were once used to collect trash, all because of an angry king.

Jai Singh Prabhakar, the Maharaja of Alwar in Rajasthan, India, was one of the wealthiest men of his time. Known for his extravagant lifestyle, he indulged in luxuries that few could imagine, like flying his pet horse first-class and changing outfits more frequently than most people change socks.

This story revolves around his infamous clash with Rolls Royce, the epitome of automotive luxury. Rolls Royce cars have always been symbols of wealth and exclusivity, typically owned by the elite.

During a visit to London in the 1920s, Maharaja Jai Singh Prabhakar walked into a Rolls Royce showroom dressed casually. The salesmen, judging by his appearance, ignored him, assuming he couldn’t afford their cars.

Offended by their arrogance, the Maharaja left the showroom, only to return later dressed in full royal attire, accompanied by a grand entourage. The salesmen, realizing their mistake, quickly changed their approach, offering him the finest service. In response, the Maharaja purchased every car in the showroom, paid in cash, and ordered additional cars to be shipped to India.

However, instead of showcasing his new collection, the Maharaja decided to teach Rolls Royce a lesson. Once the cars arrived in India, he ordered them to be used to collect garbage in the streets of Alwar. The luxurious Rolls Royce was now serving as garbage trucks, much to the embarrassment of the company.

News of this reached Rolls Royce headquarters, and they were alarmed. Concerned about their brand’s reputation, the company executives pleaded with the Maharaja to stop using their cars in this manner. They even offered him additional cars for free as a gesture of apology.

Eventually, the Maharaja agreed to stop using the cars for trash collection but kept the extra cars as a reminder of the incident.
