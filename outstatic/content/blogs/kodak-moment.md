Remember those Kodak commercials from the 90s? What ever happened to them?  Kodak, once a dominant force in photography, made a series of strategic missteps that ultimately led to its decline. The company’s biggest mistake was its failure to embrace digital photography despite being one of the pioneers in the technology. In 1975, Kodak engineer Steve Sasson developed the first digital camera. However, Kodak’s management worried that digital technology would ruin the highly profitable film business, so they suppressed the innovation instead of trying to profit from it.

As the digital revolution gained momentum in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Kodak was slow to adapt. Competitors like Sony, Canon, and Nikon aggressively pursued digital photography, capturing significant market share. Meanwhile, Kodak clung to its traditional film products. It only made half-hearted attempts to enter the digital market, often producing subpar digital cameras that failed to compete with the quality and innovation of other brands.

Kodak underestimated the shift in consumer behavior and social media, transforming photography from a physical, printed medium to a digital, shareable experience. While the world moved towards instant online sharing of images, Kodak remained committed to printing and physical photo products, missing out on opportunities.

Furthermore, Kodak’s business model, heavily reliant on selling film and processing chemicals, became obsolete as digital photography replaced the need for these products. By the time Kodak attempted to change and embrace digital technology, it was too late. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2012 after years of declining sales.

Now, with the arrival of smartphones, digital photography has become commonplace, and traditional cameras are primarily used by professional photographers and dedicated amateurs. Although Kodak still exists today, it is a shadow of the heavyweight it once was in the 1980s and 1990s.
