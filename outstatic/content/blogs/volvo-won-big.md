Why spend millions on a Super Bowl ad when you can grab everyone’s attention for free? That’s exactly what Volvo did during the 2015 Super Bowl, and it’s a story that’s still being talked about today.

While other car companies were shelling out huge sums for flashy commercials, Volvo took a different approach. Instead of buying an ad, they encouraged people to tweet about Volvo whenever a competitor’s car ad aired. The idea was simple: nominate a loved one using the hashtag #VolvoContest for a chance to win a new Volvo.

The response was huge. As other car brands showcased their latest models on TV, Volvo was trending on Twitter. The #VolvoContest hashtag exploded, with over 55,000 tweets during the game. The buzz generated an estimated $200 million in free media coverage—without Volvo spending a single dollar on a Super Bowl ad.

And the impact didn’t stop there. Volvo’s clever move led to a 70% increase in sales of their XC60 model in the month following the Super Bowl.
