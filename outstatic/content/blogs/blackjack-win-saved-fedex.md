You've heard of the underdog story, right? Well, this one involves a college paper, a daring gamble, and a company that changed the world.

Meet Fred Smith, the visionary behind FedEx. Back in the 1960s, while still a student at Yale, he had a groundbreaking idea: revolutionize shipping by air. His professor wasn't impressed, giving the paper a C. But Smith was determined.

Fast forward to 1971, when Smith turned his dream into reality with FedEx. But running a business isn't always a smooth ride. Soaring fuel costs and economic headwinds pushed FedEx to the brink of bankruptcy. With only $5,000 left in the company's coffers, desperation set in.

In a move that would be considered reckless by most, Smith took the company's last dollars to Las Vegas and played blackjack. Against all odds, he won $27,000, giving FedEx a much-needed lifeline. It wasn't a sustainable business model, but it bought Smith and his team some crucial time.

With renewed determination, Smith secured additional funding and turned FedEx around. The company went public in 1978 and has since become a global shipping giant.

Today, FedEx delivers over 1.2 billion packages a year to more than 220 countries.
