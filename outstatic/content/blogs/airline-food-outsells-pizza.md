Domino's Pizza, India's reigning pizza champion with over 2,000 stores, has long dominated the food service industry. But in a surprising turn of events, IndiGo Airlines has taken the lead in food profits within the Indian market.

How did an airline outdo a pizza giant in the food business? According to IndiGo's 2023 financial report, the airline's food and beverage profits soared to Rs 532 crore (around $65 million), surpassing Domino's India, which reported Rs 356 crore (approximately $43 million).

IndiGo's success comes down to a combination of smart strategy and a captive audience. With limited food options on flights, IndiGo has crafted a menu that passengers actually want, and they're willing to pay a premium for it.

Boasting a remarkable 70% net profit margin on their in-flight food and beverage sales, IndiGo has turned what was once a simple service into a major profit center. This shift highlights that even in a price-sensitive market like India, quality and convenience can drive consumers to spend more.
