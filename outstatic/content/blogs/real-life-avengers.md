When we think of the Avengers, images of superheroes with extraordinary powers and high-tech gadgets come to mind. But the true story of defiance, courage, and resilience during World War II comes from a group of ordinary people who embodied the spirit of the Avengers long before the comic book heroes existed.

In the Vilna Ghetto, amidst the horrors of Nazi occupation, a group of Jewish resistance fighters emerged, calling themselves the "Nokmim," which means "Avengers" in Hebrew. Unlike their comic book counterparts, these real-life Avengers didn’t have superpowers or cutting-edge technology. Their leader, [Abba Kovner](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/abba-kovner), was not a military strategist or a warrior by training—he was a poet. Yet, in the face of unimaginable odds, Kovner and his comrades took up arms to resist the Nazis.

The Nokmim engaged in guerilla warfare, executing targeted assassinations of Nazi officials and collaborators. They disrupted enemy operations, sabotaged infrastructure, and fought with fierce determination to avenge the countless lives lost and the ongoing atrocities. But their battle wasn't just physical; they waged a cultural war as well. Amidst the chaos, they smuggled out diaries, poems, and works of art, ensuring that the stories and experiences of their people would not be erased from history.

Abba Kovner’s call to arms was as much about preserving the memory of the Jewish people as it was about resisting the Nazis. In his manifesto, he declared, "Let us not go like sheep to the slaughter!"—a rallying cry that inspired many to fight back.

Interestingly, Stan Lee, the co-creator of the Marvel Comics’ Avengers, was Jewish, and some speculate that the name "Avengers" may have been inspired by these real-life heroes. Whether or not that’s true, the legacy of the Nokmim remains a powerful testament to the impact ordinary people can have when they come together to fight for justice.

So, while Captain America and Iron Man may dominate the silver screen, let’s not forget the real-life Avengers—those brave souls in the Vilna Ghetto who fought with nothing but their courage, creativity, and an unbreakable will to survive.
