In the world of sportswear, few realize that two of the industry's biggest brands, Adidas and Puma, were born from a fierce family feud. The rivalry between the founders—two brothers—not only changed their personal lives but gave rise to two global giants that dominate the sportswear market to this day.

Adolf (Adi) and Rudolf (Rudi) Dassler grew up in Herzogenaurach, Germany, and despite their father’s wishes for them to pursue different careers, they followed his path into shoemaking. In 1925, the brothers combined their skills—Adi with a passion for product design and Rudi with a knack for sales—and founded Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik. The company’s reputation skyrocketed when athletes like Jesse Owens wore their shoes during the 1936 Berlin Olympics, securing international success.

Despite their business success, tensions between Adi and Rudi began to grow. The most likely cause of their falling out was a combination of personal and wartime issues. By 1948, the brothers had gone their separate ways.

Adi Dassler founded Adidas, while Rudi established Puma. Their feud not only created two of the biggest sportswear companies in history but also intensified competition that fueled innovation. Adidas grew by signing major athletes like Muhammad Ali, while Puma carved its path with endorsements from stars like Usain Bolt. Their rivalry pushed both brands to new heights, turning them into global giants.

Herzogenaurach, the brothers’ hometown, became deeply divided by the feud. The split was so intense that residents chose sides, even frequenting different shops and businesses depending on their allegiance to either Adidas or Puma. To this day, both companies remain headquartered in Herzogenaurach, though the Dassler family no longer controls them—French luxury group PPR owns Puma, while Adidas has various shareholders. The local rivalry has mostly faded, replaced by historical pride in their global impact.

Even in death, the brothers remained apart. Adi and Rudi are buried on opposite sides of the Herzogenaurach cemetery, a final symbol of their lifelong rivalry. Despite the personal bitterness, their legacy has left an indelible mark on the sportswear industry, with Adidas and Puma now standing as two of the biggest global brands, worth billions, shaping the way athletes and consumers worldwide dress and perform.
