Ever wondered how a simple idea can make a fortune? Let’s talk toothpaste.

Back in the 1950s, a big toothpaste company was struggling to boost sales. They were stumped. What could they do to get people to buy more of their product? So, they decided to open the floor to ideas, promising a big cash reward for the best solution.

That's when a genius struck. Someone, who wasn't even part of the company, came up with a mind-bogglingly simple idea: make the hole in the toothpaste tube bigger.

It sounds crazy, right? But this tiny tweak was about to change the game. The company was skeptical at first. The idea guy was asking for a cool $100,000 for what seemed like a no-brainer. But desperate times call for desperate measures. They took the plunge.

And boy, are they glad they did!

By simply widening the hole from 5mm to 6mm, people started using more toothpaste. It was like a magic trick that boosted sales by a whopping 40%! The company behind this brilliant move? None other than Colgate-Palmolive.

Fast forward a few decades, and the hole has grown even bigger. It's now around 8mm. That's a 250% increase in nozzle size since the original idea.
